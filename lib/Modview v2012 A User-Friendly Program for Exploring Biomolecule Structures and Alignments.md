# Modview v2012: A Powerful Tool for Biomolecule Visualization and Analysis
 
Modview v2012 is a software program that allows users to visualize and analyze multiple biomolecule structures and/or sequence alignments. It can interface with local or remote bioresources to provide graphical user interface (GUI) and analytical tools. Modview v2012 is used as a database interface in several structure-sequence protein resources.
 
Modview v2012 has a great function to view and handle huge models with fast graphic performance. It can display different types of molecular representations, such as ribbon, wireframe, spacefill, or surface. It can also show secondary structure elements, hydrogen bonds, disulfide bridges, and solvent accessibility. Users can manipulate the models by rotating, zooming, translating, or selecting parts of them.

Modview v2012 can also perform various types of analyses on the biomolecule structures and/or sequences. It can calculate distances, angles, torsions, contacts, clashes, and Ramachandran plots. It can also align sequences or structures using different methods, such as BLAST, ClustalW, or CE. Users can compare multiple models or alignments using different criteria, such as RMSD, sequence identity, or structural similarity.

One of the most important types of biomolecules in terms of structure and function are enzymes. Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts for biochemical reactions, meaning that they speed up the reactions without being consumed or changed by them. Enzymes are essential for many processes in living organisms, such as metabolism, digestion, DNA replication, and gene expression.
 
Enzymes have specific shapes that determine their functions. The shape of an enzyme is determined by its amino acid sequence and the interactions between the amino acids. The shape of an enzyme can be described at four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. The primary structure is the linear sequence of amino acids in the protein chain. The secondary structure is the local folding of the chain into regular patterns, such as alpha helices and beta sheets. The tertiary structure is the overall three-dimensional shape of the chain, resulting from various interactions between the side chains of the amino acids. The quaternary structure is the arrangement of two or more protein chains into a complex.
 
The shape of an enzyme is crucial for its function because it determines how it interacts with its substrate - the molecule that the enzyme acts on. The substrate binds to a specific region on the enzyme called the active site. The active site has a complementary shape and charge to the substrate, allowing them to fit together like a lock and key. The binding of the substrate to the active site induces a slight change in the shape of the enzyme, called induced fit, which facilitates the catalysis of the reaction. The product of the reaction is then released from the enzyme, which returns to its original shape and can bind another substrate molecule.
