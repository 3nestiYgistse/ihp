Conan the Destroyer follows the adventures of Conan (Arnold Schwarzenegger) after he avenges the death of his lover Valeria in Conan the Barbarian. He is approached by Queen Taramis (Sarah Douglas) of Shadizar, who promises to resurrect Valeria if he agrees to help her niece Princess Jehnna (Olivia d'Abo) find a mystical horn that can awaken the god Dagoth. Conan agrees, but he is unaware that Taramis plans to betray him and sacrifice Jehnna to Dagoth.
 
Conan is joined by his friend Malak (Tracey Walter), a thief and comic relief, and Akiro (Mako), a wizard and narrator of the film. They also meet Zula (Grace Jones), a fierce warrior woman who becomes loyal to Conan after he saves her from some bandits. Along the way, they encounter various dangers and enemies, such as a wizard named Toth-Amon (Pat Roach) who can transform into a giant snake, a tribe of cannibals who worship a horned god, and a castle guarded by mirrors that reflect monsters.
 
Conan eventually learns of Taramis' treachery from her captain of the guard, Bombaata (Wilt Chamberlain), who tries to kill him several times. Conan also develops a romantic interest in Jehnna, who has a crush on him. Conan manages to retrieve the horn and return to Shadizar with Jehnna, but he is captured by Taramis' soldiers. Taramis then stabs Jehnna and attaches the horn to Dagoth's statue, which comes to life as a monstrous creature. Conan breaks free and fights Dagoth, while his friends battle Taramis' army. Conan succeeds in killing Dagoth by ripping off his horn, while Taramis is killed by Zula. Conan then frees Jehnna, who is revived by Akiro's magic.
 
The film ends with Jehnna becoming the new queen of Shadizar and offering Conan to be her king and husband. Conan declines, saying that he has his own destiny to fulfill. He rides away with his friends, while Akiro narrates that Conan will become a king by his own hand.
