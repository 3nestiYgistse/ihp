The osd\_horizon\_offset parameter controls the vertical position of the heads-up display (HUD) on the screen. It has been changed to make it easier to understand and use. Previously, a positive value for osd\_horizon\_offset would move the HUD down, and a negative value would move it up. This was counter-intuitive and confusing. Now, the opposite is true: a positive value moves the HUD up, and a negative value moves it down. This means that if you had set a non-zero value for osd\_horizon\_offset before, you will need to change its sign to get the same result. For example, if you had osd\_horizon\_offset = 1 before, you will need to change it to osd\_horizon\_offset = -1. And vice versa.
