The Minto Morley Reforms, also known as the Indian Councils Act of 1909, were a series of reform measures enacted by the British Parliament to introduce the elective principle to membership in the imperial and local legislative councils in India[^2^]. The reforms were named after Lord Minto, the viceroy of India, and John Morley, the secretary of state for India.
 
The main features of the reforms were:
 
- The number of members in the Imperial Legislative Council was increased from 25 to 60.
- The number of members in the provincial legislative councils was also increased.
- For the first time, Indians were allowed to elect some of their representatives to the councils.
- The act established a "quota system" which fixed the proportion of seats that would be reserved for each community at the legislature.
- The act thus legalised communalism and Lord Minto came to be known as the father of communal electorate.

The Minto Morley Reforms were seen as a step towards self-government by some Indians, but they were also criticised by others for dividing the Indian people on communal lines and for not granting enough representation and power to them.

The Minto Morley Reforms were followed by the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms in 1919, which further increased the Indian representation and introduced the concept of dyarchy, or dual administration, in the provinces. However, these reforms also failed to satisfy the Indian aspirations for greater autonomy and democracy.
 
The Indian National Congress, the largest political party in India, launched a series of movements and campaigns to demand complete independence from the British rule. Some of the prominent leaders of the Congress were Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhash Chandra Bose, and Vallabhbhai Patel. They used various methods of non-violent and violent resistance to challenge the British authority.
 
The Muslim League, another major political party in India, advocated for a separate nation for the Muslims of India. The leader of the Muslim League was Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who proposed the idea of Pakistan as a homeland for the Muslims. The Muslim League opposed the Congress and its vision of a united India.
 
The British government finally decided to grant independence to India in 1947, after facing immense pressure from the Indian leaders and the international community. However, the independence came with a partition of India into two countries: India and Pakistan. The partition was accompanied by widespread violence and displacement of millions of people along religious lines.
