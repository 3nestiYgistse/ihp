## Steps to Recover Data from BitLocker-Encrypted Volumes with Diskinternals Efs Recovery 15 Serial
 
1. Download and install Diskinternals Efs Recovery 15 Serial from the official website.
2. Launch the program and select the BitLocker-encrypted volume that you want to recover.
3. Enter the password or the recovery key when prompted. If you don't have them, you can try to use the built-in BitLocker Reader feature that can scan for possible passwords or keys on your computer.
4. Select the recovery method: fast or full. The fast method searches existing and deleted files and takes several minutes. The full method also restores partition structures and searches for signatures. This method will take much longer, but it is preferable if you have a reformatted or damaged disk[^1^].
