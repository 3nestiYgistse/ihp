# Jose Rizal: A Biography of the Philippine National Hero
 
Jose Rizal was a Filipino polymath, patriot, and martyr who is widely considered as the national hero of the Philippines. He was born on June 19, 1861 in Calamba, Laguna to a wealthy and educated family. He excelled in various fields of arts, sciences, and letters, and became fluent in several languages. He also traveled extensively in Europe, Asia, and America, where he observed the conditions of his fellow Filipinos under Spanish colonial rule.
 
Rizal wrote two novels, Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, which exposed the abuses and injustices of the Spanish friars and officials in the Philippines. These novels sparked the Filipino nationalist movement and inspired many revolutionaries to fight for independence. Rizal also wrote essays, poems, letters, and other works that advocated for reforms and human rights in his homeland.
